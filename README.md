    We used the CIFAKE dataset, which gathered images from the following sources: 

    Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

    Bird, J.J. and Lotfi, A., 2024. CIFAKE: Image Classification and Explainable Identification of 
        AI-Generated Synthetic Images. IEEE Access.

    Real images are from Krizhevsky & Hinton (2009), fake images are from Bird & Lotfi (2024).
